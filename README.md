# Kuralli_Matris
There are random numbers 1 and 0 in an nxn square matrix. These numbers are 0 or 1 according to a certain order, this order is as follows: if a value is in the same state as the value above and to the right (both 1 or both change 0 at that value (if 1 is 0, 0 is 1), Other alternative Note: The top of a value in the top row means the value in the bottom row of the next column; the right of a value in the rightmost column refers to the value on the far left of the next row. 0 <= k <= 2x109, 2 <= n <= 5 and all values ​​change the situation according to the current state of the surrounding values ​​at the same time.
